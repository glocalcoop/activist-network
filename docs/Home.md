# Network Main

This theme for Wordpress Multisite allows you to create your own network of websites. It includes a directory, a news feed, a calendar, a page or site for each group, and a home page that aggregates posts and events from all members. 

There are three types of membership:

1. Admins set up and maintain the site. They have a featured feed on the home page.
1. Groups get a fully hosted website. It comes with a blog, a calendar, and a newsletter.
1. Partners (who have their own sites) get a profile page with their logo, links, and aggregated RSS feed.

To get started, read the setup instructions.
